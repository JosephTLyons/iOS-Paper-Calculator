Bugs:

1) Performing a single calculation, then performing another using another operator
   on the last total doesn't work.  When switching operators, the value stored in
   operand is moved to total, which is causing the issue.

2) Logic for setting storage isn't correct.  This has to due with the current logic
   of showing two different outputs (operand and total) to the editor.  Rework logic
   so that total is the only one being shown (like in the first version), so that the
   total is always whats being show (except when typing in a new number, which will be displayed),
   then just store total in storage.

3) Precision when working with some floats is incorrect (under the hood?).

4) Cant toggle function button twice

5) Selecting an operator twice before hitting equals screws up the calculation - this is due to
   The nature of moving the operand to total, if done twice, the second time moves a zero to total

6) Exponential notation happens way too soon

7) Clicking equals doesn't always output the right value

Features:

1) Set output font to right justify somehow
