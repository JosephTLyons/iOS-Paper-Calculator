Bugs:

1) Be able to show both first and second number typed in output textEditor

2) Precision of the float under when working with some floats is incorrect (under the hood?).

3) Exponential notation happens way too soon

4) Input into variables A and B work fine (from total only, still no way to get it from operand),
   but the issue is that setting the value to total has issues.  We can't perform operations on them
   since both A and B set them to total - need to figure out how to set one to operator and one to
   total.'

Features:

1) Set output font to right justify somehow

2) FUNC automatically untoggles after next button click
