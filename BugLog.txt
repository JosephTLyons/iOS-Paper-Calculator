Bugs:

1) Precision of the float under when working with some floats is incorrect (under the hood?).

2) Exponential notation happens way too soon

Features:

1) Set output font to right justify somehow

2) FUNC automatically untoggles after next button click - TEMP FIX ONLY, TURNS IT OFF WHEN
   A, B, or CLEAR are hit.  Change this to all buttons in the future.

3) Be able to chain operations together (EX. 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 vs 1 + 2 = 3 + 3 = 6)

4) Make it so only values in operand and storage only show when they have a value, but not
   when they only contain zero (disappear whne not needed philosophy)
